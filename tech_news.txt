Big Four firm KPMG launched KPMG AI Trust, a suite of services to help clients with AI reliability, 
accountability and transparency as they scale AI applications. 
The suite of services offers a set of tools to help clients navigate the complexities of AI intake, 
assessment, development, deployment, management and monitoring to make AI systems secure, compliant and 
ethically sound. The core set of assessment, inventory, integration, workflow and reporting capabilities 
include Risk-tiered AI Solution Intake Evaluation, a systematic approach to assessing the risk levels of 
AI solutions so they meet necessary standards and business needs. AI Inventory and Controls offers centralization
 of AI tools and application of Trusted AI Controls to enable application of policies and risk standards. 
 AI Solution Pre-Launch Validations provides testing and validation processes to vet AI systems before deployment. 
 Dynamic Regulatory Applicability Assessments provide continuous monitoring and adaptation to changing regulatory 
 and compliance landscapes. KPMG has activated AI Trust with ServiceNow's AI Control Tower technology, 
 with the aim of continuously updating AI governance as technology and regulatory environments evolve. 
 Clients can automate AI-related compliance processes to continuously monitor for regulatory and 
 internal control compliance and embed the ServiceNow AI Control Tower on their platform.
